!!! 0.9.1: Beta patch 1
* Added setting to 'flatten' the appearance of the spell cards, making them look a bit less like buttons.  This new option is on by default.  Press the @@.inner-image;[img[assets/images/settings.svg]]@@ icon to configure this new setting to your liking.
* Disabled zooming on mobile devices.  This should make the app feel much more responsive and prevent the 'sliding around' effect of some UI elements when scrolling on mobile.  You can still adjust the size of the apps's text and presentation by adjusting the font-size option in the settings menu.
* Added the Open Gaming License to the license list.
* Added credit to [[vorpalhex|https://github.com/vorpalhex/srd_spells]] in About modal.
* Added this changelog and a version number to the About modal.
